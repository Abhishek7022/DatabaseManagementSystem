******************** Let's Learn about Database Management System ********************

1. What is DMBS?
        DBMS stands for Database Management System and is widely used to store and manage organizational data. DBMS ensure data consistency, persistence, and integrity.

Advantages:

        Data consistency:
            Ensures the data is consistent throughout transactions and data operations.

        Data Independence:
            Abstracts the details about the data storage from the applications using the data.

        Data integrity and security:
            Rules and regulations are enforced to maintain data accuracy and prevent unauthorized access to the database.

        Effiency and concurrency: 
            Allows multiple users to access the database simultaneously and data efficiency is ensured by algorithms for quering and retrival of data.

        Backup and restore: 
            Mechanisms help in data retrival in case of failures.


Types of databases:
        
        Relational Database Management System (RDBMS):
            Storage: Uses tables to store data and manage relationships between the data.
            Examples: MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle Database.

        NoSQL DBMS:
            Storage: Unstructed or semi-structured data, and flexible schemas.
            Examples: MongoDB, Cassandra, Redis and Neo4j.

        Object-oriented DBMS:
            Storage: Stores data as Objects, similar to object oriented programming.
            Examples: db4o, ObjectDB

        Heirarchial DBMS:
            Storage: Organizes data in a tree like structure with parent-child relationships.
            Examples: IBM Information Management System (IMS)

        Network DBMS:
            Storage: Uses a graph structure to represent many to many relationships between data.
            Examples: Integrated Data Store (IDS)

Most popular databases:

        Oracle, MySQL, Microsoft SQL Server, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, Redis.


*****Important categories in SQL:
     1. Data Definition Language(DDL):
            DDL commands are used to define and modify the structure of database objects.
            These commands include:
                 CREATE
                 ALTER
                 DROP
                 TRUNCATE


     2. Data Manipulation Language(DML):
            DML commands are used to manipulate data within existing database objects.
            The commands to manipulate data:
                 SELECT
                 INSERT
                 UPDATE
                 DELETE

     3. Data Control Language(DCL):
            DCL commands are used to control access to data in the database.
            Some DCL commands are:
                 GRANT
                 REVOKE

     4. Transaction Control Language(TCL):
            TCL commands manage transactions within the database.
            Some useful TCL commands:
                 COMMIT
                 ROLLBACK
                 SAVEPOINT
                 SET

     5. Data Query Language(DQL):
            DQL is used to query the database and retrieve data. It is considered to be a subset of DML.
            Command used for querying database:
                 SELECT
