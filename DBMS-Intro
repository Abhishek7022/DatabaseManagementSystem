******************** Let's Learn about Database Management System ********************

1. What is DMBS?
        DBMS stands for Database Management System and is widely used to store and manage organizational data. DBMS ensure data consistency, persistence, and integrity.

Advantages:

        Data consistency:
            Ensures the data is consistent throughout transactions and data operations.

        Data Independence:
            Abstracts the details about the data storage from the applications using the data.

        Data integrity and security:
            Rules and regulations are enforced to maintain data accuracy and    prevent unauthorized access to the database.

        Effiency and concurrency: 
            Allows multiple users to access the database simultaneously and data efficiency is ensured by algorithms for quering and retrival of data.

        Backup and restore: 
            Mechanisms help in data retrival in case of failures.


Types of databases:
        
        Relational Database Management System (RDBMS):
            Storage: Uses tables to store data and manage relationships between the data.
            Examples: MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle Database.

        NoSQL DBMS:
            Storage: Unstructed or semi-structured data, and flexible schemas.
            Examples: MongoDB, Cassandra, Redis and Neo4j.

        Object-oriented DBMS:
            Storage: Stores data as Objects, similar to object oriented programming.
            Examples: db4o, ObjectDB

        Heirarchial DBMS:
            Storage: Organizes data in a tree like structure with parent-child relationships.
            Examples: IBM Information Management System (IMS)

        Network DBMS:
            Storage: Uses a graph structure to represent many to many relationships between data.
            Examples: Integrated Data Store (IDS)

Most popular databases:

        Oracle, MySQL, Microsoft SQL Server, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, Redis.
